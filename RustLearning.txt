What is Rust

 - is a systems programming language like C and C++
 - Rust uses compiler - means that the code is translated from our code to machinecode

Rust started as side project by Graydon Hoare in 2007

Rust is most admired language for 7 consecutive years by programmers - data from Stack Overflow survey

Reason for love is Rust has nice balance - Speed, Safety, Concurency, Portability

"Cargo" is package manager for Rust

Rust webpage is rust-lang.org

Install Rust Linux

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Check after install if it is OK

in terminal

$ rustup --version

$ cargo --version

For me these commands did not work right away, was necessary to restart terminal




Hello World program

create folder - in my case folder RustHelloWorld and in this folder file hello.rs

Main entry point in program is main function

When we have our code done, we can try to run program, command

$ rustc hello.rs

if there are no errors will run generated file, in this case hello - in Linux without type. In Windows
is hello.exe

run generated file

$ ./hello

result in terminal is Hello World!
