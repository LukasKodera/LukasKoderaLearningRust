What is Rust

 - is a systems programming language like C and C++
 - Rust uses compiler - means that the code is translated from our code to machinecode

Rust started as side project by Graydon Hoare in 2007

Rust is most admired language for 7 consecutive years by programmers - data from Stack Overflow survey

Reason for love is Rust has nice balance - Speed, Safety, Concurency, Portability

"Cargo" is package manager for Rust

Rust webpage is rust-lang.org

Install Rust Linux

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Check after install if it is OK

in terminal

$ rustup --version

$ cargo --version

For me these commands did not work right away, was necessary to restart terminal




Hello World program

create folder - in my case folder RustHelloWorld and in this folder file hello.rs

Main entry point in program is main function

When we have our code done, we can try to run program, command

$ rustc hello.rs

if there are no errors will run generated file, in this case hello - in Linux without type. In Windows is hello.exe

run generated file

$ ./hello

result in terminal is Hello World!


Same program by Cargo package manager

in terminal

$ cargo new helloProject

will create folder called helloProject

In the folder helloProject, there is file Cargo.toml and folder src

Cargo.toml contains settings for our project

When we want to run code from cargo "cd" into given folder and in terminal

$ cargo run





Primitive data types

 - Rust is statically typed language
 
 - there are four - int, float, bool, char


INT (Intergers)

 - i8, i16, i32, i64, i128: signed integers - can store negative and positive integers
 - u8, u16, u32, u64, u128: unsigned integers - can only store positive integers

Floats

 - f32, f64

Boolean


Character Type - char


Compound data types

arrays, tuples, slices, and strings (slice string)

Arrays are sets of elements of the same type
